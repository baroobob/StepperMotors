StepperMotors
=============

This is a Python module for controlling a stepper motor.  A Portescap 20MO20D1U. This is a 5 Volt, unipolar stepper motor with a step angle of 18 degrees.  This module relies on the LabJackU12 module because I used the labjack to control these stepper motors with custom interface hardware to provide the necessary power to drive the motors.
